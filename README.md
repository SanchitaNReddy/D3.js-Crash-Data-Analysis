# D3.js-Crash-Data-Analysis
This project demonstrates the creation of an interactive data visualization using D3.js. The final visualization consists of two complementary visualizations presented on a web page:
1. A tree diagram showing groups of speed zones and the years when accidents occurred.
2. A timeline displaying the trend of accident counts over each day of the week.

The visualization will feature interactive elements, such as tooltips and dynamic highlighting, allowing users to explore patterns in accident occurrences across time and location.

## Features and Interactivity
The visualization allows for an interactive exploration of the accident data. Key features include:
1. Hover interaction: Tooltips and visual highlights on mouse hover over nodes or timeline bars.
2. Dynamic focus: Interactive features that allow users to focus on specific time periods or speed zones, enhancing the exploration experience.
3. Visual encodings: Colour, opacity, and thickness changes to represent accident counts and highlight key data points.

## Technologies Used

1. D3.js: For building the interactive tree diagram and timeline.
2. HTML/CSS: For the layout and styling of the page.
3. JavaScript: For implementing the interactive features and dynamic visualizations.
